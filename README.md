<details><summary>How it works</summary>

When you click on a link, it will create and submit a new GitHub issue with the desired action. This action triggers a GitHub workflow, which runs a small Typescript script responsible for executing the specified action in the blackjack game. The script then updates the content of the README file to reflect the current game state and commits the changes back to the repository.
